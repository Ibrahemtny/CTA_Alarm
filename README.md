# CTA Alarm

**Your Personal CTA Transit Tracker**  
CTA Alarm is your go-to app for real-time transit notifications, keeping you updated on bus and train arrivals in Chicago. Whether you're commuting to work or running errands, this app ensures you‚Äôre always on time by notifying you about upcoming transit arrivals right when you need it.

---

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Transit Alerts** (Pending CTA API): Once fully integrated, the app will fetch **live** data about upcoming train and bus arrivals, ensuring you always know when your ride is coming.
- **Customizable Notifications**: Set the notification time based on your preference, whether it‚Äôs 5, 10, or 15 minutes before the arrival time. 
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: This feature will predict delays using historical data and train patterns. Right now, we're simulating this with basic logic, but when fully implemented, it will use real-time data and machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- **User Preferences**: Save your favorite stations and routes, so you never have to enter them again. Your preferences are stored in a local SQLite database for persistence.
- **Offline Mode**: No internet? No problem! The app will continue to work offline, using locally cached data to keep you updated.
- **Voice Notifications**: Don‚Äôt want to look at your screen? Let the app read your notifications aloud using text-to-speech.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Customize your app‚Äôs look by toggling between light and dark themes for a smoother experience.
- **Notification Sounds & Vibration**: Get notified with custom sounds or vibrations so you never miss a reminder.

### About the CTA API

This app is designed to pull **real-time** data directly from the **Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)** API, but **API integration is still pending**. Here's a breakdown of what that will bring to the table once it‚Äôs in place:

- **Real-Time Arrival Data**: The app will dynamically fetch the next arrival time for buses and trains at your selected station. No more guesswork!
- **Predicted Delays**: Using **historical transit data**, the app will be able to predict delays and give you timely alerts, so you know if your bus or train is running late.
- **Stations & Lines Data**: The CTA API will provide a comprehensive list of stations and transit lines, which will be used to populate the app‚Äôs dropdowns and allow you to easily select the station and line you want to track.
- **Upcoming Features**: With the API, we plan to integrate machine learning to improve delay predictions, which will analyze patterns in arrival times and external factors (e.g., weather, time of day, historical delays) to give you better accuracy.

Currently, this app is simulating the CTA data with hardcoded values, so once the API is connected, you'll get **live, up-to-the-minute updates**.

### Installation & Setup

 **Clone the repo**:


git clone https://github.com/Ibrahemtny/CTA_Alarm.git




# CTA Alarm

A Qt-based app for receiving CTA transit arrival notifications with support for voice notifications and offline mode.

## Getting Started

### Open in Qt Creator
1. Launch Qt Creator and click **Open Project**.
2. Select the `CTA_Alarm.pro` file from the repo directory.

### Get Your CTA API Key
To access real-time data, you'll need to obtain an API key from the [CTA Developer Portal](https://dev.careers.cta.org/).
1. Register for an account on the CTA Developer Portal.
2. Get your API key.
3. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the code with your personal API key (found in `notificationapp.cpp`).

### Build & Run
1. In Qt Creator, click **Build** to compile the app.
2. After the build process finishes, click **Run** to launch the app.

**Note:** Currently, the app is not yet integrated with the CTA API, so it will simulate arrival data using hardcoded values. Once the API is live, the app will automatically fetch live data.

## How Does the App Work?

### Step 1: Select Your Station and Line
Choose a station (e.g., "Station A") and a transit line (e.g., "Red Line") from the dropdown menus.

### Step 2: Set Your Notification Time
Choose how far in advance you‚Äôd like to be notified about the next arrival. The app features a customizable timer that adjusts based on the distance of the train or bus from your location, ensuring you're notified at the perfect time!
### Step 3: Notifications
Once the app receives arrival data (or simulated data for now), it will send you a notification. The app can also use text-to-speech to read the notification aloud!

---

## Offline Mode

If you're not connected to the internet, the app can still display data from previous sessions through local caching. This allows you to track stations and routes even when offline.

---

## Voice Notifications & Themes

### Voice Notifications
The app uses Qt's `QTextToSpeech` module to read your notifications aloud. This is perfect for hands-free operation!

### Light/Dark Mode
You can toggle between light mode (default) and dark mode, depending on your preference. Switch between the two with a button in the settings.

---

## Offline Data Caching
Even without an internet connection, CTA Alarm will function! It caches recent transit data locally in an SQLite database, allowing you to continue tracking stations and routes, even when offline.


Made with Effort in Chicago! üèôÔ∏è Gracias Y Adios!
